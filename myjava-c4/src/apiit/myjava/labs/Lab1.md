## Java primitive types and operation

Exercise:
---
1. Write a program that reads in the radius and length of a cylinder and computes volume using the following formulas: area = radius * radius * PI volume = area * length

2. Write a program that reads an integer between 0 and 1000 and adds all the digits in the integer. For example, if an integer is 943, the sum of all its digit is 16.

3. Write a program that receives an ASCII code (an integer between 0 and 128) and displays its character. For example, if the user enters 97, the program displays character ‘a’.

4. Write a program that reads an integer and checks whether it is even. For example, if your input is 25, the output should be : Is 25 an even number? false If your input is 2500, the output should be: Is 2500 an even number? true

5. Write a program that reads in investment amount, annual interest rate, and number of years, and displays the future investment value using the following formula. futureInvestmentVal = investmentAmount x (1 + monthlyInterestRate) <sup>numberOfYears*12</sup>
